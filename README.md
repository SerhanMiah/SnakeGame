# Project - Snake Game in C#




## Project Overview

A solo project where I used C#, WPF, System.Windows, System.Drawing, and DispatcherTimer to create a classic Snake game. This project demonstrates how to build a simple yet engaging game using C# and Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) for the user interface. The game includes essential features like snake movement, food spawning, collision detection, and score tracking.

The Snake game is built using the following key components:

Snake Class: This class represents the snake itself, including its body segments, movement, and collision detection. It is responsible for managing the snake's growth, movement, and checking for collisions with the boundaries or itself.

Food Class: This class represents the food that the snake consumes to grow. It is responsible for generating random food locations on the game board while ensuring that it does not spawn on the snake's body.

GameState Class: This class is responsible for managing the game's overall state, including the snake and food objects, the game's current direction, and the game over status.

MainWindow Class: This class represents the main user interface of the game. It handles user input, updates the game state, and redraws the snake and food on the game board. It also manages the game loop using a DispatcherTimer, which ensures that the game runs smoothly and updates at a consistent rate.

Direction Enum: This enumeration is used to represent the four possible movement directions for the snake: Up, Down, Left, and Right.

By combining these components, the project provides a complete and functional Snake game that can be played on a Windows computer using the arrow keys to control the snake's movement. The game tracks the player's score, which increases as the snake consumes more food, and displays a "Game Over" message when the snake collides with the boundaries or itself.


## The Brief



## Technologies used:

### Front end:
* WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
* XAML (Extensible Application Markup Language)
* System.Windows.Shapes
* System.Windows.Media
 ### Back end:
* C#
* System.Drawing
* System.Windows.Threading
### Dev Tools:
* Visual Studio
* .NET Framework
* Git
* GitHub
* Windows OS
* Microsoft Developer documentation
* Stack Overflow (for troubleshooting and support)

Note: In the case of the Snake game in C# using WPF, the front end and back end are closely tied together since it's a standalone desktop application. Thus, the front end and back end technologies are mostly integrated.
